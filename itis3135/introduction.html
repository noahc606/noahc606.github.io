                            <li><b>Personal Background:</b> I was born on an American military base in South Korea and lived there for the first few years of my life. Being part of a military family I have also lived in many different places throughout the States. We moved to North Carolina about 6 years ago when my father retired from the Army and got a cybersecurity job.</li>
                            <li><b>Professional Background:</b> None related to computer science (yet). My father has many comp-sci connections at his workplace because he specializes in cybersecurity.</li>
                            <li><b>Academic Background:</b> I am a senior here at UNCC, and I will have a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science (concentration in Cybersecurity). I am also minoring in Mathematics. I only have 4 classes to do this semester and 3 to do next semester until I reach my 120 hrs in order to graduate.</li>
                            <li><b>Background in this Subject:</b> I took a small web design class as an elective in high school. That's where I learned the basics of HTML/CSS and to this day that’s where most of my knowledge of this subject comes from.</li>
                            <li><b>Primary Computer Platform:</b> Win11 (school notebook), Linux (home PC).</li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Courses I'm Taking & Why:</b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>MATH3163 - Intro to Modern Algebra:</b> This is the last class I have to take to fulfill my Math minor. I chose this particular course because I like doing mathematical proofs.</li>
                                    <li><b>ITIS3135 - Web App Design and Development:</b> I want to build my own site(s).</li>
                                    <li><b>ITIS4260 - Introduction to Cybersecurity Analytics:</b> This course allows me to learn more about cybersecurity which is my concentration.</li>
                                    <li><b>ITCS4155 - Software Development Projects:</b> This is my capstone course. I went with this one in particular because I would like to be experienced in both software development and networking/cybersecurity.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by:</b> I am really good at math.</li>
                            <li><b>I'd Also Like to Share:</b> My main hobbies are video games, programming/technology, running, swimming, reading, and (occasional) writing.</li>
