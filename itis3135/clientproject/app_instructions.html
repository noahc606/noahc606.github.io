            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>
                You have reached the instructions page for Technical Portfolio Studio, the revolutionary app that can help you get started building your own personal website.
            </p>
            <p>
               And... it's completely free.
            </p>
            <h2>What is This?</h2>
            <p>
                For my client project, I decided to create a website builder for a technical portfolio website.
                I was inspired by the BYO Intro assignment and several ideas a friend of mine had.
                Actually, he had envisioned a Java graphical application that would build the HTML code as a string.
                I suggested to him the idea of making it a web application instead - 
                the benefit of a web app is that the user could have a live view of what their website would look like as it was being built.
            </p>
            <h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
            <p>
                You can navigate to what will become your very own website(s), by clicking the "My Site" button on the bottom left corner.
                Once there, you will be in one of two "page building modes": "<code>Preview</code>" or "<code>Edit</code>".
                By default, you will be in the "<code>Edit</code>" mode, but you can switch between the two at any time, simply by clicking on the respective button.
                Clicking on them right now does nothing, since you are not in the "My Site" section of the application.
            </p>
            <h3>Edit Mode</h3>
            <p>
                In this mode, you can delete, edit, and create different elements of the page itself.
                For now, this is limited to paragraphs and headings, but this functionality will expand to other common web elements in the future.
                It won't be able to do everything you want, but the goal here is to
            </p>
            <h3>Preview Mode</h3>
            <p>
                In this mode, you can preview the webpage you are on as if it were a real physical page.
                Everything you do within the <code>Edit</code> mode will automatically show up on the preview mode.
            </p>
            <h2>Advanced Settings</h3>
            <p>
                At the end of the box on the bottom left, you will see an "Advanced..." button.
                Here, you will be able to have much more control over the look of your website, as well as access some extra settings.
