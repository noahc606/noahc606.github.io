                        <h3>Site: <a href="https://linux.die.net/">Linux Documentation</a></h3>
						<p>This website has several links to help with the Linux command line, bash scripting, and other topics. There is a small navigation bar on the left and page content fills the middle and right of the page. </p>
						<p>Taking the CRAP principles into consideration:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Contrast: Not enough contrast - Links on the main page don't change color at all. The whole home site is made up of three colors. Most of the sub-pages are not given any styling at all. </li>
							<li>Repitition: Very few colors make up the whole page so there is no room to mess up on this one. There is a little too much repetition for my taste. </li>
							<li>Alignment: The navbar is clearly visible and all links on the navbar are aligned with the others.</li>
							<li>Proximity: All relevant elements of the same type (links, text, paragraphs) are close to each other as they should be. </li>
						</ul>

                        <h3>Site: <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a></h3>
						<p>This website allows visitors to search for any topic of their choosing to find information about it. It is available in many different languages and is straightforward to use.  </p>
						<p>Taking the CRAP principles into consideration:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Contrast: Although all links are blue, the page is made up of many different colors. It is clear what is what. There is a bar separating the language links with links on the bottom. Below that there is a footer with privacy/terms/etc.</li>
							<li>Repitition: Repitition is used effectively. Similar elements (language links, external sister sites) of the same group have the same text size and text color. </li>
							<li>Alignment: Language links are arranged around the main logo in a satisfying manner. Links with their descriptions are arranged in clickable boxes in the lower section of the body. </li>
							<li>Proximity: Language links are all in one section and external sister sites are all in their own section as well. The sections are separated by a large horizontal line in the middle. </li>
